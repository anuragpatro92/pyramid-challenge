# pyramid-challenge

This is Restful web service which takes input as a string and returns true and false if it is a pyramid.

A word is a ‘pyramid’ word if you can arrange the letters in increasing frequency, starting with 1 and continuing without gaps and without duplicates.
Examples:
banana is a pyramid word because you have 1 'b', 2 'n's, and 3 'a's.
bandana is not a pyramid word because you have 1 'b' and 1 'd'.
